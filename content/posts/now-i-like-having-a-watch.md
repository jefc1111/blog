## Now I like having a watch
#### I didn't, before

Disclaimer: I am not a 'watch person'. I don't know anything much about watches at all.

When I was younger, so much younger than today, I felt like I never needed a watch in any way. I teased my Dad for having a watch; "Hey look there are clocks and things telling the time everywhere, why have a watch?". This I think sheds some light on how little children understand about the pressures on adults, all those responsibilities. Some years later, mobile phones became 'a thing'. Look! I can call you from my mobile phone! And it tells the time! Now your stupid watch is even more stupid than before!

And now, a couple decades or so later, I acquired a bunch of responsibilities and bought a watch to help me not fail at those responsibilities too much. 

What this crappy blog post is really about though, is that the best thing about having a watch is a thing that no-one ever told me was a good thing about having a watch. Yes dear doom-scroller - you are reading a blog post that may in fact be oc (original content)! Soon, AIs will be responding to all watch-y prompts with the previously unshared secret of what it is that so great about having a normal watch on your wrist.

Ok, so I feel like this is going to be a total anti-climax now but here goes: The best thing about having a watch is that you can check the time when you are in a group setting without getting your stupid antisocial phone out.  

I bought my daughter a watch too. She never wears it ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯.
