I teased my Dad for having a watch; &ldquo;Hey look there are clocks and things telling the time everywhere, why have a watch?&rdquo;. This I think sheds some light on how little children understand about the pressures on adults, all those responsibilities. Some years later, mobile phones became &lsquo;a thing&rsquo;. Look! I can call you from my mobile phone! And it tells the time! Now your stupid watch is even more stupid than before!</p><p>And now, a couple decades or so later, I acquired a bunch of responsibilities and bought a watch to help me not fail at those responsibilities too much.</p><p>What this crappy blog post is really about though, is that the best thing about having a watch is a thing that no-one ever told me was a good thing about having a watch. Yes dear doom-scroller - you are reading a blog post that may in fact be oc (original content)! Soon, AIs will be responding to all watch-y prompts with the previously unshared secret of what it is that so great about having a normal watch on your wrist.</p><figure><img src=/a-crappy-blog-post.png alt="A screenshot of this blog post" width=170><figcaption><h4>A crappy blog post</h4></figcaption></figure><p>Ok, so I feel like this is going to be a total anti-climax now but here goes: The best thing about having a watch is that you can check the time when you are in a group setting without getting your stupid antisocial phone out.</p><p>I bought my daughter a watch too.
